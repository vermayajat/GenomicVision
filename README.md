🌐 GenomicVision: Decoding Life Through Code

A Next-Gen Web Platform for DNA Sequence Analysis

📖 Overview

GenomicVision is an interactive web-based platform that empowers users to analyze DNA sequences in an intuitive and meaningful way.
By combining dynamic programming algorithms with a clean user interface, GenomicVision helps researchers, students, and bioinformatics enthusiasts explore:

The longest common subsequences (LCS) between DNA samples

Evolutionary relationships through comparative sequence analysis

Genetic mutations and sequence mismatches

Functional insights into genetic data

Whether you’re learning genetics or working on bioinformatics research, GenomicVision provides a simple yet powerful way to study DNA.

🚀 Features

🧬 DNA Sequence Comparison – Compare two DNA sequences and find their longest common subsequence (LCS).

🌱 Evolutionary Analysis – Explore genetic similarities to infer evolutionary relationships.

⚡ Mutation Detection – Identify mismatches and mutations across DNA sequences.

🔎 Functional Insights – Understand the biological significance of DNA similarities and differences.

💻 User-Friendly UI – A minimal, interactive web interface for seamless analysis.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend

HTML5 – Structure and content

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Interactivity, validation, and algorithms

Backend (optional for extension)

Node.js – For server-side DNA analysis (future-ready)

Express.js – API handling for scalable requests

Other Tools

Mermaid – For diagrams and architecture visualization

🏗️ Architecture

GenomicVision follows a client-server model:

Frontend: Captures DNA sequences from the user, displays results dynamically.

Backend (Node.js/Express): Processes advanced analysis (e.g., mutation tracking, data storage).

Algorithms: Uses dynamic programming to compute longest common subsequences (LCS) and mutations.
