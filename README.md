🌐 GenomicVision: Decoding Life Through Code

A Next-Gen Web Platform for DNA Sequence Analysis

📖 Overview

GenomicVision is an interactive, web-based platform designed to empower users to analyze DNA sequences in an intuitive and meaningful way. By combining dynamic programming algorithms with a clean, user-friendly interface, GenomicVision allows researchers, students, and bioinformatics enthusiasts to explore:

1.The longest common subsequences (LCS) between DNA samples

2.Evolutionary relationships through comparative sequence analysis

3.Genetic mutations and sequence mismatches

4.Functional insights into genetic data

Whether you are learning genetics or conducting bioinformatics research, GenomicVision provides a simple yet powerful tool for DNA analysis.

🚀 Features

🧬 DNA Sequence Comparison – Compare two DNA sequences and compute their LCS.

🌱 Evolutionary Analysis – Analyze genetic similarities to infer evolutionary relationships.

⚡ Mutation Detection – Identify mismatches and potential mutations in DNA sequences.

🔎 Functional Insights – Understand the biological significance of DNA variations.

💻 User-Friendly UI – Clean, interactive web interface for seamless analysis.
